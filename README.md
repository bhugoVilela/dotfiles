# Dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles for quickly
getting my Dev Env up and running on a new macbook

## Instalation
### From Git
1. Clone the repository
2. run `bootstrap.sh`

### From scratch
It doesn't need to have any dependencies installed
not git, homebrew, anything. You can run this on
a fresh macbook

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhugovilela/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh | zsh

```
This will download the bootstrap.sh script and execute it

## TODO
- vscode settings
- iTerm2 settings
